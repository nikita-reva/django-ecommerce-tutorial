# django-ecommerce-tutorial

Building an ecommerce website with django.

This project is based on a tutorial series by Dennis Ivanonv (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ELCMngbM0E&list=PL-51WBLyFTg0omnamUjL1TCVov7yDTRng). 

During this tutorial, I gained a lot of new knowledge. For example, I learned how to handle cookies on a website and how to integrate and test Paypal payments. 

I have gained valuable insights on how to structure an ecommerce application and will apply this knowledge in future projects.
